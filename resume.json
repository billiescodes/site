I understand current practices, and how technology is likely to change in the coming months. My math background helps me to stay up-to-date with developments in deep learning and other AI fields relevant to NLP. \n\n Currently, I am super into functional programming and learning about type systems. I think Docker is amazing and am interested to see how things like now.sh, Serverless, and Apex will change DevOps. \n\n I make front ends with ES6, React, and Redux, and back ends with Node, or really any scripting language. But I love designing with Sketch, making visualizations in d3.js, or knocking something quick and dirty out in PHP. In my spare time I read about Deep Learning, functional programming, and other technology-related topics... but I have irrationally strong feeling for JavaScript. I think conversational UIs are the future and am super excited to work on them.\n\nI care a lot about education, and still teach some math whenever I can. As a board member, I also help to guide Topanga Mountain School.",

As one of two full-time developers, I had to make decisions about design, architecture, and libraries and live with those choices. I pitched projects internally, design, prototype, and built them using tools that included: Vanilla JavaScript, ES6, React, Redux, d3.js, jQuery, lodash, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Material Design Lite.

    "summary": "What does it mean to say that space expands? One approach to this question is the study of relative velocities. In this context, a non local test particle is 'superluminal' if its relative velocity exceeds the local speed of light of the observer. The existence of superluminal relative velocities of receding test particles, in a particular cosmological model, suggests itself as a possible criterion for expansion of space in that model. In this point of view, superluminal velocities of distant receding galaxy clusters result from the expansion of space between the observer and the clusters. However, there is a fundamental ambiguity that must be resolved before this approach can be meaningful. The notion of relative velocity of a nonlocal object depends on the choice of coordinates, and this ambiguity suggests the need for coordinate independent definitions. In this work, we review four (inequivalent) geometrically defined and universal notions of relative velocity: Fermi, kinematic, astrometric, and spectroscopic relative velocities. We apply this formalism to test particles undergoing radial motion relative to comoving observers in expanding Robertson-Walker cosmologies, and include previously unpublished results on Fermi coordinates for a class of inflationary cosmologies. We compare relative velocities to each other, and show how pairs of them determine geometric properties of the spacetime, including the scale factor with sufficient data. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for the existence of superluminal recessional Fermi speeds in general Robertson-Walker cosmologies. We conclude with a discussion of expansion of space."
